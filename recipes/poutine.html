        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Russet potatoes, peeled and cut into fries</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Cheese curds</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups beef or chicken broth</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the vegetable oil in a deep fryer or a large, deep pot to 350°F (175°C).</li>
            <li>Fry the potato strips in batches until golden brown and crispy.</li>
            <li>Remove the fries from the oil and drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Season the fries with salt while they are still hot.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter.</li>
            <li>Add the flour and whisk continuously to form a roux. Cook for a few minutes until 
                the roux is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Gradually whisk in the broth to avoid lumps.</li>
            <li>Simmer the gravy until it thickens, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Season the gravy with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Arrange the hot, crispy fries on a serving plate or dish.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the cheese curds evenly over the hot fries.</li>
            <li>Pour the hot gravy over the fries and cheese curds, ensuring that the cheese begins to melt.</li>
            <li>The heat from the fries and gravy should cause the cheese curds to melt slightly, creating a gooey, 
                delicious mixture.</li>
            <li>Serve the poutine immediately, while it's hot and the flavors meld together.</li>
        </ol>
