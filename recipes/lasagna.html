        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>
            Lasagna is a classic and hearty Italian dish known for its layers of wide, flat pasta sheets,
            rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel sauce, and melted cheese. The dish is typically baked to
            perfection, resulting in a savory and satisfying meal. The pasta sheets are often 
            layered with a robust meat sauce, which may include ground beef, pork, or a combination of 
            both, cooked with tomatoes, onions, garlic, and various herbs and spices.

            In addition to the meat sauce, each layer is generously spread with béchamel sauce, a white sauce
            made from butter, flour, and milk. This adds a creamy and velvety texture to the lasagna, enhancing 
            its overall flavor and richness. The layers of pasta, meat sauce, and béchamel are repeated to form 
            a substantial and indulgent casserole.

            Lasagna variations can include vegetables, such as spinach or mushrooms, for added complexity and 
            nutritional value. The dish is then baked in the oven until the pasta is tender and the top layer develops
             a golden-brown crust. Once out of the oven, it is commonly allowed to rest before serving to allow the 
             flavors to meld together.

            Lasagna is a beloved comfort food that brings people together around the dining table. Its versatility 
            and ability to be prepared in advance make it a popular choice for family gatherings, celebrations, 
            and potluck dinners.
